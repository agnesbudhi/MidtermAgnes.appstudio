/*
Ask the user if they want to do an average calculation or a random multiplication. 
>For the random multiplication, create a second function named randomMultiply that 
  multiplies a random number between 1 and 10 with a number the user provides. 
>The randomMultiply function must have two parameters. 
>All user input and output must be in main program, not in the function. 
>Output the answer in an alert window using a template literal using this format:
      The result of multiplying the random number 9 with 100 is 900. 
Example for randomMultiply function:
      if the user enters a 100, and the random number generated (between 1 and 10) is 8,
     then the answer would be 110 * 8 = 800
