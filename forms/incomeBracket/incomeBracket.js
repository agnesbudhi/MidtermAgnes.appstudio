/*
The tax brackets are:      

 income less than $30,000, tax bracket is 8%
 income less than $99,999, tax bracket is 15%
 income equal to or above $99,999, tax bracket is 25%

Requirements: 

Name all controls appropriately like we did in class. 
Use the format below for output and use a template literal:
eg. Say the user input:  100000. The output would be:
             "With your income of $100000, you are in a tax bracket of 25%"
Use at least one if/else statement.
